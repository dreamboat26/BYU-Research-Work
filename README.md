# üß¨ BYU Research Work Locating Bacterial Flagellar Motors ‚Äì YOLOv8 Implementation

This repository contains my research work carried out at BYU, it is an end-to-end pipeline implemenatation which detects and localize bacterial flagellar motors in 3D cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) reconstructions.

Leveraging the YOLOv8 object detection framework, this project encompasses data parsing, visualization, model training, evaluation, and submission preparation.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `parse data.ipynb`: Processes raw `.mrc` files and accompanying annotations to generate 2D image slices with corresponding bounding boxes suitable for YOLOv8 training.
- `visualizing the dataset.ipynb`: Provides exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of the dataset, including sample images and bounding box distributions.
- `training yolov8.ipynb`: Details the training pipeline for YOLOv8, including data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, and model checkpointing.
- `reverse engineering yolov8.ipynb`: Analyzes the YOLOv8 architecture and training process to understand model decisions and performance.
- `submission notebook.ipynb`: Generates predictions on the test set and formats them according to the competition's submission requirements.
- `final merged notebook.ipynb`: Consolidates all steps into a single, streamlined pipeline for reproducibility and ease of use.

## üß† Approach Overview

1. **Data Preparation**: Converted 3D `.mrc` volumes into 2D slices, aligning annotations to create YOLOv8-compatible datasets.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualized sample images and bounding box distributions to inform preprocessing and augmentation strategies.
3. **Model Training**: Trained YOLOv8 models with customized data augmentation techniques and hyperparameter tuning to optimize detection performance.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using metrics such as mean Average Precision (mAP) and Intersection over Union (IoU).
5. **Submission Generation**: Formatted model predictions to meet competition submission guidelines.
